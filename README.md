# Log plotter for E-Racing

Using matplotlib and python, this interface aims to enable easy plotting of selected CSV files generated by our telemetry system.

A command-line interface helps decide which files and which properties of which files will be included in a plot, and also makes it possible to include different graphics in the same final image.
